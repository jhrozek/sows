The MCPConfig loading currently accepts a home-grown format.

We want to be able to consume a more common format, here is its example:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave-search": {
      "url": "http://localhost:46988/sse#brave-search"
    },
    "fetch": {
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "fetch"
      ],
      "url": "http://localhost:13630/sse#fetch"
    },
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "url": "http://localhost:29313/sse#sequentialthinking"
    }
  }
}
```

You can consult the existing StdioServerConfig and SSEServerConfig to see which attributes are required. It is not required to keep the type, we should
be able to infer it from the item. As a separate task, we migth want to move env into stdio server config only.

Adjust existing test cases, don't create new ones.
